# Homework 6 by React course, GoIT school - Phonebook

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can find live page
[here](https://veronikanos.github.io/goit-react-hw-06-phonebook/).

There is a updated task from
[this repository](https://veronikanos.github.io/goit-react-hw-04-phonebook/) and
refactored with Redux toolkit. Styling is done by CSS modules. Contacts are
saved to browser's local storage so there are saved after the page is refreshed
and after the browser is restarted.
